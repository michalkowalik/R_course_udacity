# In this problem set, you'll continue
# to explore the diamonds data set.

# Your first task is to create a
# scatterplot of price vs x.
# using the ggplot syntax.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# ===========================================
ggplot(aes(x = price, y = x), data = diamonds) +

# correlation between price and x:
cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$x)
#(0.884)

# correlation between price and y and z:
cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$y)
cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$z)

# Create a simple scatter plot of price vs depth.

# Create a scatterplot of price vs carat
# and omit the top 1% of price and carat
# values.

# Create a scatterplot of price vs. volume (x * y * z).
# This is a very rough approximation for a diamond's volume.

# Create a new variable for volume in the diamonds data frame.
# This will be useful in a later exercise.

# Don't make any adjustments to the plot just yet.

# correlation of price and volumet for diamonds with volume > 0 and <=800:

d2 <- subset(diamonds, volume > 0 & volume <= 800)
with(subset(diamonds, volume > 0 & volume <= 800), cor.test(price, volume))


# Subset the data to exclude diamonds with a volume
# greater than or equal to 800. Also, exclude diamonds
# with a volume of 0. Adjust the transparency of the
# points and add a linear model to the plot. (See the
# Instructor Notes or look up the documentation of
# geom_smooth() for more details about smoothers.)

# We encourage you to think about this next question and
# to post your thoughts in the discussion section.

# Do you think this would be a useful model to estimate
# the price of diamonds? Why or why not?
